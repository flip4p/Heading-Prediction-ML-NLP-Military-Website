# Project-ML-NLP-Military-Website
Using machine learning, I developed a project that predicts a heading depending on the selected word.

The website https://defence24.pl is in Polish. Using the selected word as a basis, my project projects a heading. In Polish, the terms geopolityka, polityka obronna, przemysl, and sily-zbrojne refer to four groups of topics: geopolitics, defense policy, industry, and armed forces. Using machine learning and natural language processing, i have developed the opportunity to select a word from the language, and an algorithm will then predict the heading that most closely matches this word. A result is not constant as it is influenced by the headings' words. The outcome is variable and dependent on the headings used; it typically ranges from 40%, which is good (while using simple probability, we have 25% changes), to over 70%, which is excellent.
